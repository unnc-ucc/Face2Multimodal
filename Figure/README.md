# It is a collection of some important figures in the whole project.

1. ![process](process.png) 
This figure shows the predicted results(Skin conductance, heart rate and vehicle speed) after being processed by our models.

2. ![accuracy](Accuracy.jpg) 
This figure illustrates three trained models' accuracy, which for estimating heart rate, skin conductance and vehicle speed are *83.78%*, *59.89%*, and *58.60%* respectively.
